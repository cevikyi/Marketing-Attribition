In evaluating marketing effectiveness, we compared three attribution models: 
Last Touch, Linear, and Time Decay, each highlighting different aspects of the customer journey. 
  Last Touch emphasizes the final interaction, 
  Linear values all touchpoints equally, 
  Time Decay focuses on the increasing significance of later interactions. 
Choosing the right model depends on your marketing goals and the specific customer behavior relevant to your product or service, with a combined approach often providing the most holistic insight.
